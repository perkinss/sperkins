This is my first post for my new Jekyll site.  This file is located in the `_posts` directory. 

So far I am only using the default `minima` theme, which is not very pretty, but in one week I will have learned how to customize my github pages theme with something a little prettier and more stylized.

So far I have learned that Jekyll requires me to create new posts in the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Susan')
#=> prints 'Hi, Susan' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I'm really enthused about Jekyll.  I'll be checking out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
